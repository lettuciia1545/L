Hello-everbody
--------------
-I have a bug or something
+ so basically, I went on the ACNL Save Editor as normal, and added my GARDEN_PLUS.dat file and it worked perfectly fine and loaded to the next part - my town. But when I did it again 30 minutes later, the page wouldn't load any futher and just froze after I put my file in.
PLEASE COULD YOU GET BACK TO ME ASAP, as I am doing this town for a friend. THANK YOU. Have a lovely day!
